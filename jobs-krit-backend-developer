We're a startup turned app development shop. Our small, growing team partners with non-technical founders to design and build innovative new products.

We're not out to build the next Snapchat. Instead, we create beautiful, niche software tools for B2B startup founders that can grow into profitable companies. We work on a handful of new projects every year across a variety of industries – tackling challenging problems to make "boring" software feel sexy.

Last year, we made $260,000 in revenue as a company. This year (with your help) we're on track to make over $350,000. Our clients’ products have been used by brands like Dropbox, Lyft, the NFL, Red Bull, Yale University and more.

## Who we're looking for
We're looking for a talented backend developer to take the lead on two new projects. We use Django on most projects but have also used Flask and Node as back-end frameworks. If you're fresh out of college or a code-school, then this probably isn't the right fit. Someone who's in a junior role and is ready to take on more responsibility or is more senior, but loves working on a small team could be a great fit. 

Experience with an opinionated framework is a must. But if Django isn't your cup of tea we're open to working with Rails, Phoenix, etc.

Because we're a small team working on a wide variety of projects, you’ll have to be comfortable jumping around and learning new skills with us. You don't have to be a unicorn. You do need to be willing to step in and help out on the front end. 

Communication is the key to just about everything in life, and this job is no different. We value communication skills over intense experience building scalable applications.

If this sounds like you, then consider applying! You’d be a great fit if:
- You are comfortable working with an opinionated framework like Django, Rails or Phoenix.
- You’re able to make smart architectural choices and balance the trade-offs that come with building a Minimum Viable Product.
- You’re comfortable shipping updates almost every day and tweaking things as you go rather than polishing a feature until it’s perfect.
- You can write well-tested and documented code.
- You're not afraid of JavaScript and front-end frameworks.

We’re based in Charleston, SC and would prefer to find someone who is here or willing to relocate. But we are open to working remotely with the right candidate.
