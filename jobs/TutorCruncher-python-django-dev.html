## TutorCruncher's looking for a new full time developer to join our small team in London.

# Who we are

TutorCruncher is a SaaS Startup which has quickly become the market leader in its niche. We offer specialised
business management software, working with clients all over the world to provide an outstanding service which
continues to meet and adapt to the needs of the tutoring industry.

As a company, we're dynamic in our approach and driven to help our clients get the most out of our product. We
love to work with people who share our collaborative attitude and can offer you the opportunity to have a
profound impact on a rapidly growing company in a global market. It's also great fun to work with TutorCruncher:
we like playing squash, important meetings in the pub and general experimentation with electronics.

# The role

Your role will mainly involve working on our main product, TutorCruncher, which is built in Django
(backend and frontend). Your duties would include building features, fixing bugs and looking for any
ways you think the system can be improved.

The ideal candidate should have knowledge of:

- Django(at least 1 year, and knowledge of class based views)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Git (and GitHub)

and more depending on how the role expands. We are interested in candidates who enjoy working to a high
standard, can learn fast, and like to get stuck in.

This job is on-site only, so please don't apply if you wish to work remotely. **Starting salary would be
Â£25-35k depending on experience.**

Whilst working with TutorCruncher, you'll be working across all of our products. You'll get experience
working with:

- React and Create React App
- Deploying with Heroku and AWS (multiple times per week)
- Using CloudFlare's distributed web workers
- PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- asyncio and AIOHTTP

Your duties would include building features, fixing bugs, working on the website and basically anything else
that comes up. New initiatives will be constantly explored and your role will include leading projects and using
new services and tools. We have some open source projects that you can check out, just search TutorCruncher on GitHub.
