# Senior Backend Engineer -- Data Platform
Percolate is The System of Record for Marketing. Backed by Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and GGV, Percolate is one of the fastest growing companies in enterprise software. Percolate’s all-in-one software platform helps marketers plan, create, execute, and analyze their marketing efforts. Over 800 brands including GE, Unilever, MasterCard, and IBM use Percolate to manage their global marketing supply chains. Percolate is doing for marketing what Salesforce did for CRM and SAP did for ERP.

We are looking for an experienced software developer to join our new Data Platform team in San Francisco. This team is focused on building the new analytics and search experience for Percolate, as we establish the System of Record for Marketing. This is a unique opportunity to join as an early engineer in our new SF office, influence technical direction, and set the tone for the engineering culture and product on the West Coast.

You will be focused on building and designing systems that reliably ingest diverse data sets, ensuring our data pipeline is reliable, performant, and that the data is stored correctly. You will also be involved with key technical decisions such as data modeling and datastore choice. Percolate is one of the world’s leading Marketing SaaS Platforms so designing for scale, reliability and the technical operations is key.

An exciting opportunity awaits to build a SaaS-based analytics system that will become a key part of the marketing intelligence powered by Percolate.
