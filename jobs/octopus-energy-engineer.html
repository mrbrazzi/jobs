# Octopus Energy

We are a tech-focused energy supplier for the UK market and we're looking for diligent software engineers to join us.

There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market at the moment. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular.  The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.

You'll be working for a company that is helping address climate change. We're helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon future.

# Tech

We're building a modern, event-driven infrastructure for interacting with both consumers (via the web, mobile apps and smart-meters) and the industry (eg data flows, consumption forecasting, trading on the wholesale market).

We use Python heavily: our consumer-facing site is powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework amongst other things. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, and Celery for background tasks. Client-side, we use React and React-native.

Weâ€™re hosted on AWS, and employ most of the Hashistack (Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform) in some form. We employ CircleCI and Atlas to coordinate a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, http://tech.octopus.energy/2016/05/05/django-elb-health-checks.html

Engineering standards are high. Everything we do is well tested and reviewed before it reaches production.

# You?

We're looking for strong engineers to join our team as we have a host of meaty challenges to solve. Python/Django experience would be an advantage but not a necessity - we're interested in talking to any candidate with a good track record and an interest in green energy. There's no minimum level of experience required: we'll consider everyone from graduates upwards.

You will need to be a quick learner with good attention to detail. The energy industry is complicated so we're keen to hire developers with good domain modelling skills, or experience with tackling complex domains.

Bonus points for experience with:

- Numpy, Pandas or other data-science tools
- Non-trivial Postgres experience
- Experience with AWS and/or the Hashistack
- Experience with service-driven architectures and message brokers

To apply, send a short email and CV to talent@octopus.energy explaining why you're a strong candidate.

Note, we're only considering candidates who don't require a visa to work in the UK.
