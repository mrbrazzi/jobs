# Overview

`wemake.services` is a group of technology evangelists and simply those who love to write beautiful code. 
We are dedicated to deliver products of high quality basing on best practices, broad experience and a good portion of common sense. 
We focus on large, both public-sector and commercial projects with complicated infrastructure, and we care about what we do.

We love Python and Elixir. We use JavaScript.


# Job

We are looking for middle and senoir `python` developers. 
We are 100% remote. To make our remote model work we have adopted the following process:

- We pay per task.
- The task rate is not a subject of argument in situ.
- We work only remotely.
- You are welcome to combine a full-time job with your job here.
- We exercise sound judgement, so you are welcome to introduce it whenever you feel it needs to be introduced.
- All that is interesting about the project, or might be used more then one time, must be fixed in documentation.
- Also, it needs to be mentioned that we do not spend our clientsâ€™ budgets on educating junior developers.

An we are constantly looking for new talents. If you got interested, read these two pages to join:
