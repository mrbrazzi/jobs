# About the role

Seer Security is seeking an experienced Python developer to join our small (but growing) team.  The primary responsibility of the role will be supporting an existing bespoke software platform that runs on Django, PostgreSQL and jQuery. You will be responsible for maintaining an existing codebase, as well as developing new features to grow the capability.  You will also be involved in other non-Python related projects depending on your experience and interests.

# About the company

Seer Security began operations in January 2016, and since that time we've built a reputation of delivering high quality products and services that exceed customer expectations.  We currently have three people in Melbourne, with a similar-sized team in Canberra.  What sets Seer Security apart is our people and our culture: we've built a laid-back but engaging work environment where people get on with the job, get along with each other and everyone is treated equally.

# About you

The right candidate is someone that enjoys technical challenges, and having fun while working on them.  You'll be joining a small team, so you need to be a good communicator and able to play nice.  At times, you'll need to be a jack-of-all-trades, as we have a breadth of technical challenges that are quite often solved around the oversized whiteboard in our small office.  If you don't already have some security experience under your belt, a strong interest in security will be a bonus, as that is at the core of what we do.  You'll also need to be an Australian citizen, as you may need to get a government clearance.  Non-Australian citizens need not apply.
