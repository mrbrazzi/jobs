# Overview

We're pretty proud of the Linux based (micro)service oriented architecture that we've built, and now we're looking for someone to help us take it to the next level.

Key technology we use:

- Python (2)
- Flask
- REST
- Swagger
- Docker
- Nginx
- Postgres
- Elasticsearch
- Jenkins
- Git

Day to day you'll be working together with a tight team of ambitious engineers using methodologies like TDD, Kanban, pair-programming, and CI/CD.

The ideal hire would be someone who's passionate about systems development and doesn't mind the occasional dip into frontend when need be.

Experience working with very large data-sets is a big plus.

Knowing how to spot performance bottle-necks as well as analyzing memory usage is a great skill that we'd love for our candidate to have!

Building a fault tolerant distributed system is definitely an interesting challenge, and we'd love to have you join us.

# About Suade

We are an early-stage FinTech startup based in London. We have had the pleasure and good fortune of being a part of the Techstars and Microsoft Ventures programs. We also have a partnership with Simmons \& Simmons, who are a top-tier law firm in the Financial and Technology sectors. The company was founded on the belief that there must be a better way for financial institutions to comply with complex regulations. Our journey has led us through over 500 product iterations as a result of our conversations with experts on both sides of the rules. Our solution draws on innovative tech concepts from industries as diverse as transportation, social media, e-commerce and graphic design. We are uniquely positioned with a wealth of banking and technical talent to solve this real-world problem and deliver it to the industry.
