# Overview

Table Connection is a marketplace/platform that is unlike anything on the market and will revolutionize nightlife. We are looking for someone to come and help build out this service from the grassroots. Any experience working with marketplaces is a plus.  The ideal person will be able to dedicate 10+ hours per week to this project.  We are looking for someone that can build web scrapers and develop a backend architecture that can serve mobile clients though a restful web API.

We are only able to provide equity, there is no other compensation for now, since we are a grassroots start-up.  This is perfect for someone who has a full time gig but is looking to take on a side project and be part of something great.

We are based in Los Angeles and are looking for a candidate that lives in the U.S. since we will need to make semi frequent face to face contact when working on this project.
