# About Us

One of Edinburgh’s most exciting startups, TravelNest is going through a period of rapid growth.

We’re building a team to grow with us as we aim to develop the leading SaaS platform in our sector. The company operates in a fast-paced agile environment and needs self starters who can deliver great results.


# The Role

We are recruiting software engineers at all levels to help us on our mission.

We take culture very seriously, and are looking for people who:


- Can deliver high impact in an agile and changing environment
- Understand that software is about solving customer problems as much as writing code
- Are happy to take risks and learn from failure
- Act with kindness towards each other

As an engineer, you will be working in cross-functional teams, creatively solving problems with technology. You will build products while contributing to engineering best-practices and sharing knowledge across the function and business as a whole.

Please note: as we are not currently sponsoring visas, you must be eligible to work in the UK.

# The Tech

We are building a microservice architecture consisting of both front-end and back-end components. We use a lot of Python, all hosted in AWS and utilizing various AWS products for storage, messaging etc.

We practice continuous delivery, committing code straight into production with safety through automated tests and alerts. As engineers we take responsibility for testing, deploying and monitoring the services we build.

You don’t need experience in our exact stack, just a track record of delivering successful software and an eagerness to learn. You might specialize in one area such as front-end or back-end, but will be willing to work anywhere in the stack according to most impact on our goals.

# Equal Opportunities

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or age.
