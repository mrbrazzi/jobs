# FORWARD PARTNERS

Forward Partners is the UK's largest dedicated seed stage VC with >£80m AUM. We focus on next-generation eCommerce companies and applied AI startups. Startups that we have backed include: Thread, Zopa, Appear Hear, LostMyName, and Big Health.
A large part of what we do here at Forward Partners involves investing in 'pre-seed' (idea) stage startups. Usually these pre-seed stage startups are founded by non-technical, solo founders with deep subject matter expertise. Not only do we invest in these companies but we also provide them with 12 months rent free access to our offices (a co-working space a moments walk away from Old Street roundabout in East London) and access to a team of experts. This team of experts covers all the major functions from product management, design and UX through to software development, PR & comms, ops and talent. Over the 12 months these founders are with us we help them build an MVP, scale it and get them to a point where they are raising a significant institutional VC round at a multi-million dollar valuation. We have done this for companies such as Appear Here, Patch, Live Better With, and Lexoo. 
Typically at month 6 - 12 the main requirement is to find a technical Co-founder/CTO to pick up from where our team left off and help raise the series A and help build a world-class business in the process. 
If you are entrepreneurially minded, want to get involved in a start-up at a stage where you can really make a difference and make significant upside (but don't want to take too much of a risk on an unproved idea and need a salary to survive) then register your interest here. 

6 opportunities a year.
