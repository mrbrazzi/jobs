# Overview

We are looking to make a web portal for our members, where they can login and
download a PDF copy of their financial plan. The site would require secure
logins of our customers to a personal reports page.

On this page they should be able to:
    * view current and old reports
    * download a PDF copy of reports, both password protected and unprotected.
    * (maybe) require intergration MGP (moneyguidepro) and/or Wealthbox CRM

Please submit resume, time, and price estimates to:

# Role Requirements

Candidates for this project should be proficient in Django/Pythong and Database
storage, preferably SQL (Postgers or MySQL) Open to NoSQL if warranted. They
should also have an understand of Cloud Storage solutions like S3, as we might
use that for PDF report storage. They -might- also be called on to assist in
setting up hosting for the site.
