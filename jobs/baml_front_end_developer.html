# Job Description

We are looking for Python developers to join our teams in our Downtown offices. We are looking for individuals who have interest
and expertise in bulding responsive web interfaces using Python and other web-based tools such as HTML5, CSS and Angular.

We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Financial experience is desirable but not a requirment. We can offer flexible conditions
and a stimulating, creative atmosphere. We have vacancies for both contractors and permanent employees.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting, this is primarily an office based role.
* No agencies please

# Requirements

Fluency in common web-development languages (e.g. HTML, CSS). Basic familiarity with at least one programming language (e.g. Python, Scala). 
Anything else you might bring to the job is a bonus. If you can build web-sites that are responsive, well designed and performant then 
then it is likely that you meet our requirments.

# How to apply

Email a resume to robert.donnelly@baml.com. Covering letters are not required.

All candidates will be asked to show a portfolio of work samples which demonstrate ability to implement web user experiences.
Our interview process will include a colaborative design exercise.
