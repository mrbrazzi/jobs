# Overview

Incuna is looking for a backend web developer to join our team based in Oxford, UK.

Knowledge of Django would be ideal, but having worked on the web with Python, PHP, Ruby or Perl, and a willingness to learn, will go a long way.

Additional experience of the Django Rest Framework, Git, PostgreSQL, TDD, HTML5, JavaScript, AngularJS, or Agile development would all be a bonus.

There will be opportunities to work with the latest web and app technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and work on large, global platforms that are making a real difference in the world.

Incuna is a rapidly-growing digital agency with big ambitions: we are well on our way to becoming the leading digital agency in the healthcare sector. We have a unique team of extremely talented developers and designers who are proud to be delivering class-leading web and mobile apps. There is very little hierarchy - everyone's opinion counts and everyone does have an opinion!

You will be offered the computer platform of your choosing, regular social outings, plenty of development opportunities and a competitive salary.

We are based in beautiful Oxford with all the benefits that it brings (fantastic selection of places to eat and drink, great social opportunities and lively cultural scene).

If you are interested, we'd love to hear from you. Please apply via the link above.
