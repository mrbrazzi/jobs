* Work with security researchers to troubleshoot time-sensitive production issues
* Keep petabytes of critical business data safe, secure, and available
* Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively with members across multiple teams
* Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team
* Be mentored and mentor other developers on web, backend and data storage technologies and our system
* Constantly re-evaluate our product to improve architecture, knowledge models, user experience, performance and stability

## Qualifications:

* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (or commensurate experience in data structures/algorithms/distributed systems)
* The ability to design scalable and re-usable SOA services
* The ability to scale backend systems - sharding, partitioning, scaling horizontally are second nature to you
* The desire to ship code and the love of seeing your bits run in production
* Deep understanding of distributed systems and scalability challenges
* Deep understand multi-threading, concurrency, and parallel processing technologies
* Team player skills - we embrace collaborating as a team as much as possible
