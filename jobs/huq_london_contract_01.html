# Overview

I'm urgently seeking a freelancer to take the reigns on the backend for
a London based startup's product.

Due to scheduling mishaps I need to give up what is otherwise an
incredibly fun and engaging project on a great team, however my loss may
be your gain, so please read on.. :)

Please reply to the above email address with CV and a handful of comments about 
problems that you can see with, or ways in which you can improve the query linked to in
the body below


# Role requirements

This project would suit someone with good overall Python toolset
knowledge, at least an exposure to Django (although preferably a bit
more than that), and an existing knowledge of, or burning desire to see
PostgreSQL used in extreme anger.

The product is a mobile data analytics platform, consisting of:

* One user-facing Django application serving up an Angular app and
  implementing it's backing API using Django rest_framework. You do not
  need to touch the Angular parts, but a passing familiarity may be
  beneficial.

* One device-facing Django application serving up a separate Django
  rest_framework API and implementing a bunch of preprocessing logic for
  incoming impressions.

* A pretty hairy PostgreSQL installation, making heavy use of
  SQLAlchemy Core to generate reporting queries, along with an Rq-based
  task queue that maintains consistency between raw impression data and
  materialized summaries based on the user's filters.

  Example query: https://gist.github.com/dw/c6cf10f83d1ccb9606ff

* Device-side SDKs for Android and iOS. This role does not cover these
  components, but if you enjoy flexing your Objective C or Java skills,
  that could be a big plus.
