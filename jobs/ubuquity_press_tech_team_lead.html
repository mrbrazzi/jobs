# Overview

Our platform is specialised for open access academic publishing, which makes research available to anyone in the world, without barriers. It includes all aspects of publishing technology, as well as features designed to enhance communication among researchers, and the universities in our network.

In this full-time position, you will take on a range of responsibilities, and will be involved in all stages of the software lifecycle: from design, development, testing and deployment to maintenance. You take control of functional management of junior engineering staff members, and help set the technical direction of the company.

We envisage the ideal candidate as someone able to grow into a CTO role over time. We’re therefore looking for someone who is entrepreneurial, inventive, and who genuinely wants to have an impact on the world.

# Qualifications required

 * Strong Django skills
 * HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills with experience of object-orientated PHP
 * SQL and database design skills
 * Solid grounding in UNIX/Linux

Additional experience in the following areas would be beneficial:

 * Experience with git and Mercurial
 * Existing CMS products which work with Django such as django-cms or Wagtail
 * Maintenance and re-development of legacy systems
 * Agile processes
 * Semantic web
 * Academic research background and interests
 * Mentoring junior staff
 * Experience working with offshore development teams

# Company description

Ubiquity Press is more than a publisher – we’re also engineering new technology that will change and improve the future of research communications worldwide. We’re a young, dynamic and idealistic company, and can offer the excitement and advantages of working for a start-up, based from our offices in in London and Oakland. We have a wide focus: supporting open access university publishing, including research data and software, to solutions for the developing world.

# Application Process
