# The company
We are [Neudata](https://www.neudata.co/), a small but established start-up working in the alternative data space. We help our clients (generally sophisticated investment managers) to find new data sources that can provide unique, timely and granular indications of otherwise imperceptible economic activity. Examples include the automated measurement of oil tank contents using satellite imagery, electricity usage of manufacturers (as a proxy for production volumes), sentiment data gathered from the automated analysis of news sources.

The market for alternative data is growing strongly. We are an established and respected player in this market. We are planning significant growth to extend our current service. We need to hire talented developers to enable this growth.

Our existing tech platform is a reasonably simple Ruby on Rails application through which our clients access our research. The solution was built and is currently maintained by a small digital agency.

#The role
You will be part of a small team that will design, build and operate our new service offerings. We're looking for versatile, polyglot developers who are willing and able to work on Ruby on Rails, but who are not bound to that technology.

You are likely to be a developer who is motivated by the problem domain and by the opportunities offered by an established start-up, rather than one whose primary motivation is an individual technology.

It is essential that you have experience of front end JavaScript development. A working knowledge of Ruby on Rails is important. We also currently use Redis, Cloudflare and Algolia. 

Our office is in the Moorgate WeWork, and we are currently hiring for this location. Therefore the right to work in the UK is a pre-requisite. We are flexible about working patterns. We are committed to attracting, developing, and advancing the most talented individuals regardless of their race, sexual orientation, religion, age, gender, disability status or any other dimension of diversity.

We offer the opportunity to make a real impact on the tech culture and design decisions of a small and highly motivated company; exposure to a fascinating area where big data is changing the world of investment management; a relaxed and modern working environment where you will work alongside world-class domain experts in the field of alt data.

If you want to know more then please contact me personally at the details in the header. You can send a CV if you want or just drop me an email with an expression of interest and we can take it from there.

No agencies.
