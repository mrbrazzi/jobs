# Company Overview

Tablet (TabletHotels.com) was founded in the year 2000 by Laurent Vernhes and Michael Davis, a pair of new-media veterans in search of a cure for boring travel and an antidote to the internet’s most common affliction: an overdose of options. Our users trust our taste — we do the hard work of selecting only the most extraordinary hotels, and we make booking them as painless as it can be.

Sixteen years on, Tablet is still growing fast, and for that we credit three things: a mission with resonance, a lot of hard work, and — perhaps most important — an extremely talented team. Our New York office doubled in size in 2011, and we’re not done expanding yet.

# Responsibilities

As a technical lead you’ll partner with our Head of Technology in developing our technology, people, and processes that keep a team of seventeen cohesive as it scales. We’re tackling a third party integration which will more than double our inventory and it requires our SOA become fully distributed, an elimination of technical debt, cloud migration, and frontend redesign.

Between programming you’ll spearhead architectural discussions, mentor, and be accountable to a small team of backend engineers who appreciate elegantly simple solutions to complex problems. Leveraging your experience and intuition, you’ll present inventive solutions and acquire the necessary buy-in from your team through thoughtful discourse to meet demands of a rapidly evolving product experiencing an influx of traffic and users.

# Required Skills

* Expertise in Python
* Experience creating sensible database schemas with SQL
* Understanding of modern web services and SOA
* Knowledge of testing and continuous integration
* Familiarity with command-line Unix (we’re running FreeBSD)

# Nice to Have

* Experience working with cloud technologies
* Experience with Elasticsearch and Redis
