*Tired of the same old ERP and IoT projects?
Would you rather use your skills to help
save fuel, the environment, and lives? At Eniram, we provide
measurable benefits to our seafaring customers by crunching data to
build models and algorithms. The data we use includes e.g. wind,
waves, cargo, and crew behavior.*

*It’s a complicated but rewarding task. We use cutting-edge data
science techniques on our custom data processing platform. Real-time
data flows in from hundreds of vessels around the world.*

*Eniram is an independent business entity owned and supported by
Wärtsilä.*

Eniram is seeking experienced Python Software Developers to join the Infra
team at our Helsinki office. This agile team is responsible for
developing and maintaining numerical data processing and interactive computing
services for the company. These systems enable our data scientists and
analysts to produce insight that feeds our customer reports and
dashboards. The team’s technologies of choice are Linux, Python and
Java with emphasis on scientific computing, as well as Docker and
other cloud technologies. Their development toolbox includes GitLab,
Flowdock, and Jenkins.

# You’re a good candidate if you...

* have significant experience in one or more of the technologies we are using.
* You are eager to learn additional technologies as needed.
* enjoy designing, scaling, and optimizing complex systems to make them fast
  and usable while still being nicely maintainable.
* communicate well and are comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a small
  and talented team.

# It’s a plus if you...

* have implemented RESTful interfaces.
* know about the Scientific Python stack (NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter, Cython).
* have contributed open source code.
