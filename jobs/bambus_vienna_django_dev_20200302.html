Bambus enables home-owners to act like professional investors. Real estate assets should give their owners financial freedom and flexibility, rather than limit their options. Our approach to asset-backed lending will fundamentally change the way home-owners manage their property. 

We're funded, growing and look forward to receiving your application.
